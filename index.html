                <b>What is the introduction of BMW?</b><br>
                The BMW name stands for Bayerische Motoren Werke GmbH. BMW was created in 1917 from the Munich firm Rapp-Motorenwerke, the remarkable journey of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW), from its inception in 1916 as an aircraft engine manufacturer to its current status as a global icon of automotive innovation and luxury. The company was incorporated into Knorr-Bremse AG in 1920 before being refounded as BMW AG in 1922, as it was the successor of Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG, founded in 1916, and created in 1917 as mentioned in the beginning.

                    For decades this was BMW's highest achievement. A superfast V8 two-seater, beautifully built. That package was gift-wrapped in a gorgeous body styled by Albrecht von Goertz. It came about because BMW wanted to make a splash in America, and the company envied Mercedes' success with the first SL. Trouble is, it was too expensive, so sales collapsed. It lost money, and BMW was deep in a financial hole anyway. So they only made 252. But its influence was huge, not least on later BMWs including the Z3 and Z8.

                    Either side of WW2, BMW was known for its expensive straight-six cars (small sales) and its bubble cars and other babies (small profit). The Michelotti-styled 700 was the last of the tiddlers. Its flat-twin BMW motorbike engine was in the rear, and it was the first BMW with a monocoque body. It came as a two-door saloon, coupe and convertible, and sold by the bucketload. Hans Stuck and others won races in the 700. But after the Neue Klasse came along, BMW could see where the profit was, and gave up on small cars until the new Mini.

                    By the end of the fifties, BMW was losing money so fast it looked like Mercedes would buy it. But it swerved the reaper and did an epic reboot with the 1500, a brilliant sporty saloon known to all as the Neue Klasse (New Class). The new four-cylinder M10 engine stayed in production until 1988 and its block was used in 1,500bhp GP cars. There were also coupes, eventually stretched in the nose to make room for the straight-six, culminating in the CSL Batmobile. A shorter three-door version of the 1600/2000 spawned the 1602/2002, in effect daddy to the 3 Series.

            What is the best thing about BMW?
BMWs are known for their excellent build quality. Many other brands tend to cut corners on things like paintwork, interior materials, and dashboard design in order to save money. BMWs don't do this – and won't ever do this – they make sure everything has a premium look and feel, inside and out.
